<h1 align="center"> Lenny Bronner </h1>

I’m a data scientist at The Washington Post. At The Post, I work with stakeholders from across our newsroom and marketing team to build products and develop algorithms. These include

* algorithmic metadata tagging for articles, including topic modeling to support our recommendation and ad targeting services
* text-based image recommendation, to allow journalists to quickly find relevant images for their stories
* unstructured data search tools that let journalists quickly search over multiple data sources to find relevant ledes

Generally, I’m interested in natural language processing and quantitive text analysis. Prior to joining The Post, I worked for Sidewire, a San Francisco-based media startup that sadly no longer exists.

I have an M.Sc in Statistics and a B.Sc in Mathematical and Computational Science, both from Stanford University.

If you want to learn more about me or have a cool project you’d like to collaborate on, please feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.
