The first machine learning project I ever worked on was trying to predict political ideology based on someones twitter account. You can find my writeup [here](/assets/pdfs/cs221.pdf).

It uses directed follower information and basic linear regression to predict political leaning. As a training set is used the follower information of members of the United States Congress and their dw_nominate scores to learn weights for twitter users.

It was the final project for CS 221: Artificial Intelligence, Principals and Techniques at Stanford University. 

The main point of this project was my implementation of stochastic gradient descent, which I did from scratch.
